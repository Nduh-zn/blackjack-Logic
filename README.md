# blackjack-Logic

I am required to code the logic and rules of Blackjack 21 (not a console game of Blackjack). Use the test case provided below; I don't need to get the input from the
keyboard, but the solution should be able to run for any scenario (players and hands). The code has to be as if it was production code, I will be reviewed on code quality.
As per the test case given, determine the players' results against the dealer in a round of Blackjack, by outputting each players hand and result.

#RULES:
- Cards in a hand are summed to determine
the hand's value.
- An ace can be equal to 1 or 11, based on
the other cards in the hand. The goal is to
not exceed 21.
- Any player whose hand consists of 5 cards
without the hand exceeding 21 automati-
cally beats the dealer.
- Players play against the dealer and not
each other.
- Any player whose hand is equal to or ex-
ceeds the dealer's hand and is less than or
equal to 21 beats the dealer.
